The design breif below is in refrence to the wireframe design board in Miro:

https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPUKP3Pg=/?share_link_id=5928969487

* Colour
  * Buttons are colour coded
  * I used light blue for number buttons
  * I used light green for the reset button
  * I used yellow for operation buttons
  * I used red for the equals button
  * I used Turqoise for the screen
  * I used dark blue for the background
  
* Button design
  * All buttons are the same size except for equals
  * Equals is 4 times as big because it is very important and more commonly used
  * Instead of "AC" I used "Reset" to  make it easier to understand
 
* Display design
  * I used a replace command to display "x" instead of "*" for multiplication
  * I used a replace command to display "รท" instead of "/" for division
  * I used "Question does not make sense" instead of "Syntax error" to make it easier to understand
  * I used "Cannot divide by 0" to make it easier to understand
  
* Layout
  * Number buttons are in a easy order for younger students to understand
  * Reset is in top right light most calculators
  * Plus and Minus are on the right side of the screen sinse they are more common for younger children
  * Divide, Multiply, and Decimal are not in such dominant ositions sinse they are less common for younger children
  * Equals at the bottom spanin across the length of 4 buttons
